# Welcome to COBRA-k's documentation ðŸ˜º

This documentation explains how to use the COBRA-k Python package, which is the reference implementation of COBRA-k (COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis with kinetics). To learn all about COBRA-k's main features, follow the numbered chapters on the left :-)

!!! info
    At the start of many chapters, you may find a **quickstart** variant section, where a condensed down version of the chapter's code is presented.

    Also note that, in this documentation's formulas, bold capital letters represent matrices (e.g. $\mathbf{X}$), bold small letters vectors (e.g. $\mathbf{x}$) and italic letters single numeric values (e.g. $x$).

For more about COBRA-k's features, code and license, visit its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/klamt-lab/cobrak).

If you use COBRA-k in your academic work, please cite its publication:
